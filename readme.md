## Project Title:
Virtual Guest Games Exploring Career Paths

## Project Description:
The "Virtual Guest Games Exploring Career Paths" project aims to provide an interactive and engaging way for players to explore different career paths through virtual games. The platform allows users to choose career paths, explore them by progressing through various levels, and mint Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as they achieve milestones in their career journey.

This decentralized application (dApp) is powered by smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, offering a secure, transparent, and gamified experience where users' progress and achievements are rewarded with unique NFTs. Players can also trade or display these NFTs as proof of their career exploration.
